## What is DNS  ? 
ðŸ”¹ DNS refers to the Domain Name System.

It functions similar to the "phone directory of the internet." 
It converts domain names (such as www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.14), allowing computers to locate one another on the network.

## Why DNS is Needed?
Humans remember names (www.facebook.com).
Computers need IP addresses (157.240.22.35) to communicate.
DNS helps us use easy names while computers get the correct IP behind the scenes.
